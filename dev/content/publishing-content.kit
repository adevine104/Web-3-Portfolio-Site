                                        <p>I designed a print magazine from the ground up as a project for my

                                            concept that I thought up and a borrowed article from The Atlantic. I then
                                            created the masthead, refined
                                            the idea behind the magazine, worked on the imagery and got started building

                                    <p>
                                        Eileen Gray, who despite being labled an archtect, was more prolific in
                                        furniture design. This design pulls from her wood-laqured screen she created in
                                        1922. I tried to subtly
                                        capture the angles of the original panels, left open spaces in the screen and
                                        changed the color of a few of
                                        the panels to make it work as an abstract design. My goal was to capture the
                                        essence of this piece and not
                                        to just recreate it exactly. For the typography I angled the letters and placed
                                        them in a way to
                                        mimic the panels. The informational text was placed to resemble the placement of
                                        the panels while
                                        also using reversefigure ground to pop against the intricate background. I
                                        pulled the color palette from a piece of artwork hanging in her most famous work
                                        of architecture, her E1027 house. I feel that
                                        my interpretation of Eileen shows an aspect of her style that people forget
                                        about. She thought of herself as
                                        experimental and always changing and I think I picked a piece that has
                                        architectural and sculptural aspects to it which shows her versatility and
                                        range.

                                        This is a series of posters for a fictional lecture series on water pollution.
                                        In this design I tried to mimic the trickling of water with the elongating “L’s"
                                        and “I” in “Pollution.” I showed the progression of this drip throughout the
                                        series to show the passage of time. I also tried to show variations like
                                        inverted colors and raising the design up on half of them to make it easier to
                                        differentiate the events from the one before.

                                    <p>I was commissioned to make a flyer for a webinar about race in sports,
                                        specifically the sport of rowing. The time frame was extremely rushed so I
                                        decided to recreate the concept I made in these posters. Instead of a feeling of
                                        water dripping I created an oar. I had more freedom with this project than the
                                        last so I played with color to reinforce hierarchy. Finally, the client
                                        requested photography so I played with a monochromatic style to tie it in with
                                        the design more easily. </p>
