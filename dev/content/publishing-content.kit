            <p>I designed a print magazine from the ground up as a project for my publication class. I started with a
                concept that I thought up and a borrowed article from The Atlantic. I then created the masthead, refined
                the idea behind the magazine, worked on the imagery and got started building my creation. </p>

        <p>
            I designed a Poster for a fictional lecture event hosted by Drexel University for a famous architect.
        </p>

        <p>
            My architect for this project was Eileen Gray, who despite being labled an archtect was more prolific in
            furniture design. This design pulls from her wood-laqured screen she created in 1922. I tried to subtly
            capture the angles of the original panels, left open spaces in the screen and changed the color of a few of
            the panels to make it work as an abstract design. My goal was to capture the essence of this piece and not
            to just recreate it exaclty. For the typography I angled the letters and placed them in a way so that they
            could mimic the panels. I also placed the informational text to resemble the placement of the panels while
            also using reverse figure ground to make the words pop against the intricate background. The color is one I
            pulled from a piece of artwork hanging in her most famous work of architecture, her E1027 house. I feel like
            my interpretation of Eileen shows an aspect of her style that people forget about. She thought of herself as
            experimental and always changing and I think I picked a piece that is not just furniture but also has
            architectural and sculptural aspects to it that shows her versatility and range.
