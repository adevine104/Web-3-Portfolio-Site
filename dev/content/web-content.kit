                                    <p>In my first web design class we had to pick an event-based website to remake. I
                                        searched around a bit and
                                        landed on the mummers site. I decided that something involving so many vibrant
                                        colors and
                                        fun shapes should have that represented on its website. I went to work creating
                                        a color palette that I felt
                                        was
                                        large enough and vibrant enought to emcompass the feeling you get when you go to
                                        the Mummers Parade. I then
                                        create dynamic layered shapes to help break up the sections and move you through
                                        the content. I then added
                                        animations to make it feel like more of an
                                        immersive experience. Click the link below to experience it for yourself! </p>

                                    <p>This project was created by me and team of three other people. We had to make a
                                        one page scroller about why
                                        someone should go camping. My section’s goal was to recognize why someone
                                        wouldn’t want to go camping and refute
                                        those concerns to put the viewers mind at ease. I tried to make this a fun
                                        experience by having a
                                        treasure-map-like line draw itself from each concern to each rebuttal. I added
                                        cartoonish drawings to bring
                                        life to the words, drawing them in the same style as the animations of another
                                        one of my group-mates section
                                        to tie the site together! This was a unique project and the first time I created
                                        this kind of animation. I
                                        found it to be fun, challenging and extremely rewarding when it finally came
                                        together! </p>

                                    <p>I began learning how to code in May of 2020 during a pandemic that turned my
                                        world upside down. Learning this new skill not only felt like a new opportunity
                                        for my future, it helped me cope with what was happening to the world around me.
                                        I decided to use my new found skills to code my own portfolio site to display my
                                        work instead of using a template site. I did not make it easy for myself, deciding to
                                        go with a slanted trope throughout the site and using an accordion method to
                                        display my content, but it was so worth it. I learned a lot while creating this
                                        site and hope to continue to advance my skills so I can make something even
                                        better in the future.</p>
