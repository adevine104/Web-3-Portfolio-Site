            In my first web design class we had to pick an event-based website to remake. I searched around a bit and
            landed on the mummers site. I decided that something involving so many vibrant colors and
            fun shapes should have that represented on its website. I went to work creating a color palette that I felt was
            large enough and vibrant enought to emcompass the feeling you get when you go to the Mummers Parade. I then
            create dynamic layered shapes to help break up the sections and move you through the content. Below I added
            three sections that demonstrate this in application. I then added animations to make it feel like more of an
            immersive experience. Click the link below to experience it for yourself!
