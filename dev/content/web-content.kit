                                    <p>In my first web design class we had to pick an event-based website to remake. I searched around a bit and
                                        landed on the mummers site. I decided that something involving so many vibrant colors and
                                        fun shapes should have that represented on its website. I went to work creating a color palette that I felt
                                        was
                                        large enough and vibrant enought to emcompass the feeling you get when you go to the Mummers Parade. I then
                                        create dynamic layered shapes to help break up the sections and move you through the content. I then added
                                        animations to make it feel like more of an
                                        immersive experience. Click the link below to experience it for yourself! </p>

                                    <p>This project was created by me and team of three other people. We had to make a one page scroller about why
                                        someone should go camping. My section’s goal was to recognize why someone wouldn’t want to go and refute
                                        those concerns to put the viewers mind at ease. I tried to make this a fun experience by having a
                                        treasure-map-like line draw itself from each concern to each rebuttal. I added cartoonish drawings to bring
                                        life to the words, drawing them in the same style as the animations of another one of my group-mates section
                                        to tie the site together! This was a unique project and the first time I created this kind of animation. I
                                        found it to be fun, challenging and extremely rewarding when it finally came together! </p>

                                    <p>I made a logo for a fictional tech company called STARTECH. I struggled with the
                                        idea of technology at first
                                        thinking I had to avoid the most obvious ideas to make it more interesting and
                                        less obvious. I played with
                                        different patterns and styles to try and convey this word and after realizing
                                        what I’d done was too
                                        illustrative I started again from scratch. My next set of designs were much more
                                        abstract and I tried to
                                        incorporate some cliches into my design to get back to the basics. I finally
                                        settled on a circuitboard
                                        pattern I created. I then played around with the design and took apart pieces of
                                        it, rotating them to show a
                                        more organized version of the mark. I decided to add a twist by taking the
                                        asymmetrical route for my final
                                        design. </p>
