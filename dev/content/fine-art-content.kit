    <p>In these pieces I sought to explore the feeling of being tired. As a student and an athlete with many responsibilities I know this feeling well and wanted to show it through my art in a way that people could relate to using aspects of surrealism. I focused on different sides of the feeling of being tired in my art: waking up, getting through the day, and completing tasks. I also took a closer look at some of the side effects of being tired: daydreaming, low energy and lack of focus. Sometimes words keep us from communicating how we truly feel and I want these pieces to speak for themselves.</p>
